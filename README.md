# RandomPersonPicker
This program was wrote to randomly pick employees for drug tests and write the data to a text file for record keeping. This program/project was created because my mom asked me I could write something to help her at work.

Anyone and everyone is free to use program. I only ask that I be given credit if used by anyone else. There are no copyrights or anything attached to this program/project.

The command line interface of htis program can be found in the folder named "Command Line Interface" and make sure to read "README for CLI.md"
