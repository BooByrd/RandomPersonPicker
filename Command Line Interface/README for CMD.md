This program was wrote to randomly pick employees for drug tests and write the data to a text file for record keeping. This program/project was created because my mom asked me I could write something to help her at work.

Anyone and everyone is free to use program. I only ask that I be given credit if used by anyone else. There are no copyrights or anything attached to this program/project.

In this folder, you will find the .exe all of the code for the randomPersonGenerator that uses the command line interface.

If you only want the program itself, download "randomPersonGenerator.exe" and read the directions below before running this program.

This program will be reading/writing from files on your desktop.

This program uses rng(random number generator) to pick number(s) between 1 and the total number of people from your input file. It won’t pick duplicate people based on the row number.

It uses/looks for a text file named “People List.txt” on the desktop. *This program won’t run without it*.

The random number(s) chosen are then used to find said person at row position #2 which would be Joe.

The data is wrote to a text file on the desktop called “Choosen People.txt”. This program searches your desktop to see if there is a text file already named “Chossen People.txt”. If there isn’t one, one will be created on the desktop.

This program will also write the username of whoever is logged in on the computer, along with the date and time.

Output Example Below: (username) (current date and time when program was ran) (Employee name): 7 <--This number is the row position of the person in “People List.txt” file in case it needs to be checked.
